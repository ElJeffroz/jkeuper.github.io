Hacking is not only about software, not about criminal activities, it is about learning new ways to do things beyond what the manufacturer intended the product to do. It is a way of life, never stop learning...

Many years ago, I studied the _art_ of picking locks. Not to do anything illegal, but just to learn about locks and how they work. Most importantly, open locks in a non-destructive way the manufacturer certainly did not intend to open.

I bought a lock picking set and a practice lock. Over the years I collected some other locks, formerly used in real life.

This weekend I received a call from a friend, asking whether I was still into hacking things. "Sure, you know me." I replied. He explained that he had a job to do tomorrow, but the motorcycle case he used to take his equipment was locked and he forgot to take the key with him. Of course I packed my tools and met him that evening.

Wow, this would be the first time I bring my lock picking skills in practice! I was a bit worried that these real life locks would be harder than anything I ever tried before.

## Picking the lock
The case was locked with a Yale Y110/30 padlock. To get started I googled it to see whether there were any reports about picking that type of lock. I quickly found [this](https://youtu.be/apMtPtAFHe4) video.

So I picked up my tools, selected my long rake and... Even before the video was finished playing, a crisp *click* and the padlock sprung open! Whoohoo, that earned me a beer!

## More information
When you want to give lock picking a try, you can order a beginner set online easily. Some detailed guides can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/MITLockGuide) and [here](http://index-of.es/Lockpicking/Easy%20Pickings%20-%20Mini%20Lockpicking%20Manual.pdf)

If you still feel secure about having your valuables at home with your doors locked, then you _must_ read about bump keys and core pulling. I've selected two very short (<30s) videos about [bump keys] (https://youtu.be/XQJNzZQIfss) and [core pulling](https://youtu.be/kDMqgE0CVtQ) for you to show how easy these techniques are.
