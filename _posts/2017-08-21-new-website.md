Welcome to my new website!

Finally I got fed up with my single-page website. In spired by my former co-worker Marijn from [Serra ICT](http://www.serraict.com/), I took a look at Jekyll. Soon I found Jekyll Bootstrap [here](https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io), which seem to fit my needs perfectly! It turns out, Marijn was also using it already.

Just like Marijn, I host my site at github using github-pages. It works as a charm!

A nice blog posting of Kyle Banks added some category listings to my website:

Maybe you would like to take a look at the [sources](https://github.com/jkeuper/jkeuper.github.io) of my website?

Thanks Marijn, I owe you a beer!
