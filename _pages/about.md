Since I was a kid, I alway was ripping things apart. Hopefully putting things back together working. This never stopped. I'm alway curious how things work, behind the first sight.

Now I'm a software engineer. Started in C++, switched to C#, but in the meantime always learning and using other languages. I even used assembler, learned it on the go, when some C++ routine really needed to blazing fast.
