Since I was a kid, I always was ripping things apart. Hopefully putting things back together working. This never stopped. I'm curious how things work and really want to understand how things work.

Now I'm a software engineer. Started in C++, switched to C#, but in the meantime always learning and using other languages. I even used assembler, learned it on the go when some C++ routine really needed to blazing fast. 

As a teamplayer I am a analytical and creative developer with a focus on high quality and secure code. In a team I enjoy to learn from others and share the knowledge I have.
