# My company website

Based on an Open-Source Bootstrap 3 Jekyll Theme by Scotch
https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io

See demo:
http://scotch-io.github.io/

## Development

Requires Ruby 2.3 and Make. Tested on Linux and Mac OS. 
Windows is known to behave badly with jekyll, 
although workarounds do exist.

First time use

```
make bootstrap
make serve
```

Local website available at http://localhost:4000

Run test:

```
make cibuild
```
